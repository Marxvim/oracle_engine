      "Title: N/A\n",
      "Description: DescriptionThe product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.\n",
      "Extended Description: Extended DescriptionInput validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.Input validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (seeCWE-138for more examples.)Input validation can be applied to:raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or sizeData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.Many properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified sizeindexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structuressymbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntaxlexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a tokenspecified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logicequivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the sameauthenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the dataImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation.Note that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.Finally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n",

For example, \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" is a structured message containing a command (\"GET\") with a single argument (\"/index.html\") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (\"HTTP/1.1\").If an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata.
